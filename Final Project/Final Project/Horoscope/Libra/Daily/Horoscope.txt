You're generally intuitive, Libra, but today you could be so sensitive to
others that you pick up on just about everything. Stay away from hospitals 
or police stations if you can. You might absorb everyone's pain. It's better 
to put this vibe to work spiritually or artistically. Seek friends and 
colleagues who work with you in these departments and you should have a 
wonderful day.
