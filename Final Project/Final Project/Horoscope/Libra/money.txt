When it comes to money, you usually know how to go out, make it, and spend
it, too! You can be a powerhouse when it comes to the green stuff. Take a 
look at what you bring to the table better than others, whether that's at 
work, in your ideas, or in a money relationship. You may be surprised to find 
that it's more than you had previously thought. You can use this talent now 
to cash in later.
