Begin the week with acts of self-expression when Mercury in Aquarius conj-
oins Jupiter in your sector of pleasure on Monday. This is a great day to 
express yourself creatively with outside-the-box ideas. Who knows? You 
might even discover a new art form!

However, your quest for pleasure could conflict with the breaking of certain 
taboos when Mercury squares Uranus in Taurus on Tuesday. What you find enjoyable 
might seem totally bonkers to someone else. Don’t let society decide what you 
can and can’t enjoy, Libra. As long as it’s not hurting anyone, let yourself 
have fun!

Be patient regarding family matters when the new moon is in persistent Capricorn 
and your domestic sector, creating some emotional uphill battles in your private 
life. While this might be very frustrating, try to be positive, and don’t lose 
your temper.
