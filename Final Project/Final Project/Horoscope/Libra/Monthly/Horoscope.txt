Relationships and intimacy have been major focuses for you for the last 
six months, and youâ€™re going to be feeling the urge to merge even more 
from now until March as Mars powers up your solar eighth house. You will 
be hungry to pull your special person closer than ever. This may manifest 
in yet another way, such as you being eager to tie up debts or push toward 
getting a loan, credit card, venture capital, or settlement.

However, be sure to use the earlier weeks of the month to sign contracts or 
apply for loans because our cosmic messenger Mercury turns backward on January 
30. After that, February will be riddled with delays and frustration in all 
communications and legal matters.

Romance will be significant this month and in the year to come because of so 
much focus on your solar fifth house of passion. Your ruler Venus enters here 
on the eighth to bring extra special attention to matters of the heart. 
Embrace this now or in the month ahead.

Another important focus for you in January is home and family, with the sun and 
the goddess of the night uniting to create a new moon on January 12. This 
luminary could help you find the perfect living space, move, or attend to an 
important family situation. No matter what, you can find more stability if you 
try.

The last thing to note this month is the full moon that draws attention to your 
solar eleventh house of community on the twenty-eighth. You may attend a lovely 
event at this time or feel the need to expand your network. Fun and excitement 
are sure to follow.
