It's important to your wellness to pay attention to your subconscious.
There is a lot that goes on "under the surface" and you'd rather know
about it than not know about it, right? One way to keep abreast of
your unconscious fears and desires is to keep a dream journal. This
is easier than it sounds - if you've never kept a journal before.
Simply carve out five to ten minutes every morning and sketch your
dream while you have breakfast. Insights will arise.
