Aquarius native, bringing new energy and opportunities. On January 6,
Mars enters Taurus with a focus on financial patterns you may have had
in your younger days. It’s time to focus your efforts on buying real
estate, including your own home. If you want to pay off your mortgage,
you can find extra income through a side business for this worthy goal.

On the twelfth, there's a new moon in Capricorn at about the same time
 Mars squares Saturn in your sign. You may have felt your job was
running along at a good clip, but now there are obstacles the size of
boulders in the road. It’s time for little parkour as you figure out
ways around the blocks. Confidence is key even if you have to fake it
until you make it.

There's a full moon in Leo on January 28, and Mercury goes retrograde
in Aquarius two days later. Despite Mercury moving backward in your
sign, the energy clears up considerably now as someone steps forward
to help you. Reach out to people you've worked with before and a
friend will open the door, giving a recommendation or perhaps an
introduction to the hiring manager.
