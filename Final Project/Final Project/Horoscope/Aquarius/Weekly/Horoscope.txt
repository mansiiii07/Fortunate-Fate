The week starts with classic Aquarius rebellion on Tuesday when Mercury
in your sign squares Uranus in Taurus. Some members of your family aren’t
approving your choices. However, you need to move to the beat of your own
drummer regardless of tradition. Express that as clearly as possible.

Be patient with yourself when the new moon is in Capricorn midweek. The
moon is in your sector of privacy, bringing waves of emotion to your inner
world. It’s a time for healing as old feelings make their way to the surface.
Be kind to yourself, and avoid any self-destructive habits.

This is especially important as your ruler Uranus goes direct in Taurus on
Thursday, letting out plenty of emotions. Uranus is in your home sector,
which could bring up some family drama. Fighting, childhood scars, or issues
with your domestic life are coming to the surface. Try to deal with this in
a healthy way.
