With the moon moving into Aries, we’re likely to wake up with all kinds
of invigorating energy and ambition. Choosing to try new things today
will come naturally to most, and we’ll be more willing to take a risk
and be spontaneous. Intense comments could end up in a battle of insults,
so watch your words as you deal with people throughout the morning hours.

But try not to worry too much because this transit is accompanied by the
moon-Saturn sextile to balance things out. This incites the urge to
protect your loved ones in practical ways with things like food, shelter,
and comfort. If you happen to be alone when this mood strikes, call a
relative or reorganize a photo album to harness these feelings.

In the afternoon, when the moon sextiles Jupiter, you’ll long to be with
others. Breaking the ice with someone you haven’t spoken to in a very
long time should come naturally, and you’ll likely be warmly received.
You could even find yourselves burying the hatchet once and for all.
Some other things that could result from today’s energy include givin
more attention to your social media platforms, giving a presentation at
work, speaking in public, and being the center of attention.
