Mighty Mars heats up your solar fourth house at the onset of January, so
you are especially focused on home and family matters. You could become
highly energized regarding a move or renovation or be dealing with an
important situation surrounding a family member. This will likely keep
you busy until March.

Another area of focus is about taking time to pull back and rest. The sun
and new moon meet on January 12, telling you to recharge your batteries.

Life becomes brighter when the sun joins your zodiac sign for the month
ahead, starting on the nineteenth, bringing even more power to you, along
with Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn! With so many planets in your
zodiac sign, it is clear that you have a tremendous amount of dominance
now and the ability to shift matters in your favor. Use this time to make
plans for what youâ€™d like to launch in the year ahead, and get ready to
move the pieces strategically forward.

With Venus in your zodiac sign, this is also a magical time for love,
beauty, and pleasure, so be sure to indulge yourself.

The end of January brings forth a full moon on January 28 that turns your
full attention on your partnerships. This may be a culmination regarding
you deciding to make long-term plans or else part ways. Some Aquarians
could become engaged or even marry. Others may sign contracts with business
associates. However, time is of the absolute essence because Mercury, the
 ruler of communication, stations retrograde and turns backward in your
zodiac sign on the thirtieth. Work with haste!
