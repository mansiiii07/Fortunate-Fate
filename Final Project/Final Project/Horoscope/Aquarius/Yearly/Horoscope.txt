2021 is the year to be an Aquarius! It is all about your ever-evolving
sign that presents a unique and accepting perspective to the world at
large. You are here to really provide inspiration to the planet as everyone
around you seems to be super confused about where to turn next.

Your Water-bearing sign is ready to embrace and fully appreciate the
amazing vibration gifts the universe has in store! It is truly a time
to ask your spirit guides for what you want, and find a surprise waiting
for you around every corner!

As Saturn briefly entered your sign in 2020 experiencing a six-month 
etrograde cycle, you've gotten an idea of where you are headed this year.
The structured planet is now transiting through your eccentric sign that
enjoys the unknown twists and turns that bring forward many surprises
and adventures.

The year is marked by some intense squares between Saturn in your sign
and Uranus in the fellow fixed sign of Taurus. Because you are co-ruled
by both of these two outer-bodies, this is going to be an exponential
lesson for you.

There is a strong connection to time itself these days. You might feel
throughout the year that time is either moving extremely fast or slowed
down to a glacial pace. The most pointed squares being present on
February 14, June 14, and December 24 will really test your sense of
time in general. The entire purpose of this energy is to align you with
your spiritual awareness and allow you to make decisions from your sense
of intuitive awareness.
