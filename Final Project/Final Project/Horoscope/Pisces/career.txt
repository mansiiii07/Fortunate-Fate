There is good news ahead for your career unfolding over the next few weeks.
Pisces natives are in the flow. On January 6, Mars enters Taurus and this
could bring an agreement to sell your business or add months to your current
work contract. If you're in sales, these next few weeks could be particularly
lucrative for you.

On the twelfth, there's a new moon in Capricorn at about the same time Mars 
squares Saturn in Aquarius. This is an excellent time to be working behind
the scenes. Consider upgrading equipment, working on your technology skills,
or building your website. It's a good idea to get as much done as possible
over the next two weeks.

There's a full moon in Leo on January 28, and Mercury goes retrograde in
Aquarius two days later. Changes in your company could be filtering down to
affect your position. This could be due to a merger or major change in your
department. You might be presented with the opportunity to transfer within
the company. For this decision, look at the bigger picture. Consider positions
where you'll be noticed and appreciated—or where you’ll be ignored, so you have
more time to work on your side business.
