Fun, laughter, and social vibrations fill your life as the sun ignites
your solar eleventh house at the onset of the year. With a new moon also
opening a doorway in this area of your life on January 12, it is quite
likely that you will hear from many friends and even make a new one at this
time, too! Expanding your network and joining communities will bring you
happiness and purpose if you choose to do so now. You may also attend a
lovely event during this time.

As Mars enters your solar third house, yet another area of focus this
month is on significant communication-related projects, such as writing,
speaking, or advertising initiatives. It will continue to power up your
voice until March, so expect to launch things during this time. However,
be aware that Mercury, the ruler of communication, is retrograde throughout
most of February, so you must use your time now to make the agreements
that you want to last.

There will also be a lot of planetary activity in your solar twelfth house
of privacy, assuring that your dreams and intuition are quite active now.
Use this energy to get creative or brainstorm long-term life goals.

As the month draws to a close, you will likely feel of burst of activity as
a full moon in your solar sixth house of productivity ignites in the night
on January 28. This luminary may see you finishing up an important project
or offer you an opportunity for employment. Some Pisces could even swiftly
move from one job to another.
