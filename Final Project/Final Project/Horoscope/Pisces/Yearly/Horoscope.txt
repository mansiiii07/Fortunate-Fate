Your week starts on a fun note when Mercury in Aquarius conjoins Jupiter.
There's a difficult energy to pin down this year, Pisces. You have to
really take the approach of allowing life to come as it is for your
sensitive sign of the Fish.

The most pivotal transit affecting your chart includes a series of eclipses
between Gemini and Sagittarius that activate your personal tenth and fourth
houses. These are more specifically your zones of career pursuits and family
development. Whenever you feel like you are getting out-of-control this year,
one strategy to take that will really help you is to always follow your
grounded path.

As Uranus continues to break boundaries in Taurus, this outer planet is also
met with a conflicting square with Saturn in Aquarius. This holds the element
of extremes, especially in mid-February, mid-June, and late December; but
sparks certain events that also affect your loving sign throughout the entirety
of the year.

Yes, this energy will challenge you on many levels, especially through your
personal realms of communication and psychic development. For those Pisces who
are open to their gifts, this will be extremely easy for you, and for those
who have suppressed your personal intuitive nature, this can feel a little
overwhelming at times.

You are extremely in tune with the unseen world this year, and it can feel
like you're able to predict things before they even happen! It is a good year
to work with others that support you, and also share your gifts as well. During
this fascinating year, your spiritual life might even deepen.
