You’ll get by with little help from your friends this week, Pisces. It
starts with the new moon in Capricorn on Tuesday. The moon is in your
sector of friendship, so if you’re having trouble solving a problem, enlist
your friends to help. They might come up with a clever solution.

Continue to put your networking skills to good use when the sun in Capricorn
conjoins Pluto on Thursday, bringing some transformation to your social group.
Whether you’re adding new friends, making interesting connections, bonding
with others, or learning about a social issue, it will be an eye-opening day.

The week ends on a rocky note when Jupiter in Aquarius squares Uranus in
Taurus on Sunday. Some harsh words spoken in the heat of the moment could
lead to your undoing. Instead of lashing out, take a day to be by yourself
and enjoy some self-care.
