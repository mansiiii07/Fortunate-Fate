You’re not the type who enjoys “surprises.” In fact, it’s probably your 
least favorite word, especially when it comes to your routine. However, 
when Mercury in Aquarius conjoins Jupiter on Monday, a surprising discovery 
could improve your life. This aspect is in your sector of routine, creating 
a few shake-ups that can lead to positive results. Whatever works for you, Virgo.

However, don’t let your love for the tried and true get in the way of innovation 
when Mercury squares Uranus in Taurus on Tuesday. You may be caught between the 
old ways of doing things and innovation. Is your way really the “right” way? 
Try exploring those new possibilities, Virgo.

Fortunately, the week gets better when the new moon in Capricorn is in your 
sector of pleasure midweek. This is a great time to start a creative project, 
watch a good movie, and just enjoy life.
