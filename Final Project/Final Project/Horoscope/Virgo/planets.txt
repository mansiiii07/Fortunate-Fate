When the moon squares Venus in the early hours, it increases the need for 
love and affection, and we may seem a little clingier than usual with loved 
ones. If you find yourself alone during this energy, the temptation could be 
to find comfort with a stranger, but this would be ill advised. The thing 
you’re looking for is the intimacy you can’t get from someone you don’t really 
know. Impulse purchases should also be avoided because they will also fall flat 
as a solution.

Empathy is high when the moon sextiles Mercury later. You could find yourself 
listening more deeply to others’ concerns and actively trying to assist in 
finding solutions to their issues. You’ll find most people are very forthcoming 
with their feelings and thoughts as well, which can give you new insights into 
who they are and what they believe. As usual, the more you share of yourself 
during this transit, the more you’ll get out of it. You’ll be a wonderful 
addition to any team with an open mind.

The sun moves into Aquarius later in the day, which could lead you to feel like 
you need to reconnect with anyone you haven’t spoken to for some time. You might 
visit some favorite spots you haven’t been to in a while and generally just feel 
like you’ve tapped into the collective once again. It’s a reminder of the fact 
that we’re all intertwined.
