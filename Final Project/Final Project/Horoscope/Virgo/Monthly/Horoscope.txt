Life will be very busy for you in 2021, Virgo, so get ready! Mighty Mars 
moves into your solar ninth house of expansion this month and stays until 
March. This means that many Virgos will be especially focused on academic, 
media, publishing, or international matters. Legal issues can also appear 
during this time.

However, a lovely cosmic blessing this month will be the sparkle radiating 
from your solar fifth house of fertility and romance. The sun will be heating 
this arena up like a furnace! A new moon in this zone materializes on January 
12 and opens a doorway for you to find love if you’re single or improve your 
rapport with your partner if you’re already committed. Some Virgos may have 
luck in conceiving if you’re trying. And if you harbor creative talents, new 
inspiration is certain to cross your path at this time.

However, despite the exciting new possibilities, you will begin to notice a 
slower pace approaching as early as mid-January because your ruler Mercury 
will be turning retrograde on the thirtieth. You are especially affected any 
time this occurs, and you could feel as though your mind is in a fog. Projects 
hit snags and you may feel the world grind to a halt. This period will 
especially affect your work projects, so realize that you might need to make 
some adjustments down the line in February.

The month ends with a full moon in your solar twelfth house of rest and healing 
on January 28, further causing you to pull back, wait, and reflect. Focus on 
lying low at this time to see what the universe brings your way.
