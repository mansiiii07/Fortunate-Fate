It's the new year and there are opportunities on the horizon like the 
rising sun setting the sky ablaze. On January 6, Mars goes into harmonious 
Taurus, bringing Virgo natives the ability to take action around contracts, 
permits, certifications, or patents. You have a small window now to get the 
filing done. Your application could receive preferential treatment.

On the twelfth, there's a new moon in Capricorn at about the same time Mars 
squares Saturn in Aquarius. Now it feels like youâ€™re pedaling your bike up 
a steep hill because everything seems to be taking more time and energy than 
usual. Helpers are nowhere to be found. The bright spot in this period is a 
boost in a creative project. This could be related to arts, music, or design.

There's a full moon in Leo on January 28, and Mercury goes retrograde in 
Aquarius two days later. Mercury will remain in your house of work and 
routines for another few weeks, giving you the opportunity to hire the help 
you need. Look at systems you can automate, even if it just saves you a couple 
minutes a day. Those minutes add up to energy you can use later.
