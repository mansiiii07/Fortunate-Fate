It’s still cuffing season, Leo, and if you’ve been looking for love, part-
nership, or even just a connection, now is the time! On Monday, Mercury in 
Aquarius conjoins Jupiter in your sector of partnership. Download those 
dating apps and meet your match. If you’re already in a relationship, send 
a flirty text to your partner to spice things up.

Patience is a virtue, one you don’t particularly have. However, Tuesday is 
a great day to cultivate it while the new moon is in Capricorn. The moon is 
in your sector of routine, encouraging you to develop a healthy habit, 
whether it’s a skincare routine or bedtime meditation. Practice makes perfect.

Use the sun in Capricorn conjoining Pluto on Thursday to finish up any lingering
projects you may have, especially at work. Refrain from starting a new project 
and focus on the goals you’re currently working on.
