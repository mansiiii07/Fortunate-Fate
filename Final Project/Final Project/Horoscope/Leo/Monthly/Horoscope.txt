Prepare for your professional life to shoot off like fireworks at the 
onset of January, Leo. Mighty Mars will be heating up your achievements 
and ambitions until the beginning of March. Not only will you see opport-
unities come your way, but you must use this firepower to charge toward 
your goals. You can make much progress during this window of time.

The sun will also be heating up your solar sixth house of productivity 
early on and unite with the goddess of the night to create a new moon on 
January 12. A doorway to improve your employment will open in your life. 
Look for new job opportunities, clients, or projects at this time, or ask 
your boss if you can take on more. It will aid your rise. Because this same 
house rules your health, exercise, and routine, this would be an excellent 
moment to set new fitness goals, too.

Another important theme this month centers on partnership as Mercury and 
Venus bring connection and pleasure for you in relationships. However, be 
sure to make plans and agreements as soon as you can because there is an 
impending Mercury retrograde that begins on the thirtieth.

To end a busy month, a full moon in your zodiac sign arrives on January 28 
and allows you to take center stage. The worldâ€™s eyes will turn to you at 
this time. A highly important personal goal will likely culminate. Reach 
toward it, for it may now be yours.
