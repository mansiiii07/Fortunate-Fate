You are not one to take obstacles as a reason to back down or give up. 
But it's important to recognize when you are dealing with heavy pressures 
so that you can give yourself a little TLC when needed. You enjoy pressure 
to a certain extent, but it can wear on us all and we need to call on our 
creativity to bring that sparkle back into our daily lives when it has worn 
thin. Consider giving yourself a massage as a special treat.
