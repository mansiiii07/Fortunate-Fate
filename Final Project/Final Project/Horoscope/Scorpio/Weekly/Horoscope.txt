A great day for thinking and getting your point across is when the new
moon is in Capricorn and your sector of communication on Tuesday. It can
boost your logical thinking and ability to express yourself through
writing and speaking. Sure, some people may not get what youâ€™re trying
to say, but with a little persistence you can have them seeing things
your way.

Continue using that cool logic on Thursday when the sun in Capricorn 
conjoins Pluto. It can help you solve any problems that have been plaguing
you. Suddenly a communication issue becomes easy to solve.

The week ends on a bit of a sour note when Jupiter in Aquarius squares
Uranus in Taurus on Sunday. You might feel the urge to rebel in your
current relationships. Some childhood scars or family issues could get
the way of a healthy relationship. Look inward before acting. It will
save you some heartbreak.
