Feeling a little blocked lately (emotionally or physically)? This might
have something to do with a tense period you're going through, where things
tend to get a little bottlenecked. Keep all channels open with plenty of
water and fresh vegetables and at least a few virtual yoga classes or
whatever exercise releases your tension the best. Try to do this whenever
you are subjected to a lot of stress, rather than putting it off until
afterwards. You will be much happier!
