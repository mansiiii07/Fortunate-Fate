This is an extremely important year for your powerful sign of the Scorpion. Several transits tug and pull at major points in your personal chart, bringing you brand-new perspectives, and also requiring you to implement decisions that contribute to both, your family and career life.

This combines several areas of your personal affairs and asks you to really look into your long-term arrangements from the perspective of a leader, caretaker, and healer. As 2021 brings along with it an influential square between Saturn in Aquarius and Uranus in your opposing sign of Taurus, this creates a prominent T-square in your own chart. This can be a difficult astrological energy most pointedly experienced during mid-February, mid-June, and the end of December, but leads to radical change in your overall life. There can be many unplanned events that ultimately decide your fate and affect your home and career situations. You might even consider moving for work, or relocating in some capacity.

Pluto, your home planet, enters a retrograde cycle through Capricorn between June 28 and October 7, making this timeframe a key zone to revisit what still needs to be accomplished in order to feel fully empowered and take back your personal authority in certain areas where you felt you lost your confidence. Some see you from the outside that have no idea what's been bubbling under the surface. Donâ€™t lose sight of the big picture, and always remember that the universe wants you to succeed at anything you set your mind to, and this year is no exception to that rule.
