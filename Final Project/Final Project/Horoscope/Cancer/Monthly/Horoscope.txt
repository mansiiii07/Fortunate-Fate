As mighty Mars heats up your solar eleventh house of communities and
long-term vision, Cancer, you are going to feel energized and quite
excited. This lasts until the beginning of March. Not only will you 
now see that some of your hopes and dreams are within reach, but you’ll
also see your social life erupt with excitement. Build your networks
personally and professionally during this time. You will certainly hear
from many acquaintances and likely be invited to plenty of events.

Partnership will also be on your mind in January as the sun and new moon
align on January 12. This opens a doorway for you to improve your
significant relationships and make plans together. Some Cancers could
feel the impetus to get engaged or even marry. Single Cancers can use
this vibration to find people with long-term relationship potential.
With Venus dancing through your sector of intimacy for the second half
of the month, you’ll certainly be feeling the warmth.

However, make commitments or sign contracts soon because Mercury will be
slowing down to turn backward on the thirtieth. With its impending
retrograde in your intimacy sector, you will find that you’re reassessing
where you stand in your unions and if you’re receiving everything you deserve.

The month ends with a full moon in your solar second house of finances on
January 28, which could trigger a raise, new job, or new client for those
Cancers who are freelancers. Welcome in the abundance now.
