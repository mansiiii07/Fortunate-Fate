You have been enjoying a fairly boisterous ride these last few weeks.
To help balance your energy, keep yourself on a strict diet of moderation.
This means you can eat anything you like, just do so in moderation.
Continue to enjoy your usual exercise program and above all - make your
sleep schedule as regular and delightful as possible. A little Lemon Verbena
on your pillow at night is a lovely thing to fall asleep to!
