The week takes a toll on your nerves when Mercury in Aquarius squares
Uranus in Taurus on Tuesday, creating some conflicts between your
surface-level relationships and the need for intimacy. As a water sign,
you aren’t afraid to get deep, but others may not be ready to be that
emotionally vulnerable. Respect that, Cancer. Remember that you don’t
have to go deep with everyone.

Continue to be patient with your relationships when the new moon is in
Capricorn and your sector of partnerships midweek. A new relationship
could be a marvelous thing if you can just be patient. Even love needs
some time to bloom.

However, if it doesn’t feel right when the sun in Capricorn conjoins
Pluto on Thursday, it might be time to move on. Trust your gut. If you
don’t feel a solid connection, end it. Just make sure it’s a clean break.
You don’t want any lingering feelings.
