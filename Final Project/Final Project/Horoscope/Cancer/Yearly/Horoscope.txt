Your week starts on a fun note when Mercury in Aquarius conjoins Jupiter.
You are here for a major reason, and 2021 is one of those years where
you've got to surrender to the outcome. You made some incredible changes
during 2020 and are making some real headway. There were many ups and
downs that could have felt a little more traumatic than normal,
especially for your compassionate sign of the Crab.

This year really serves as looking at your life from an outsider's
perspective. You're able to take an observerâ€™s perspective and might even
consider diving into some deep self-reflection that you once shied away
from. Working in several facets of spirituality, body care, research, and
expanding your mind, in general, is what 2021 is all about. There is nothing
too out-of-the-ordinary for you right now, as you might even be more
interested in either paranormal or occult-type studies.

You are extremely tied to the cycles of the moon, who's nodes now cycle
between Gemini in the north position and Sagittarius in the south position.
You are working out karmic cycles through learning your own patterns in
communication and understanding what stories you've been told for far too
long. You might even be faced with the truth about a family situation that
you once spent far too much time trying to resolve. Maybe you've sacrificed
your own happiness for the good of your loved ones only to come to terms
with what you really want for yourself.

This is a year where you can really step into your own independence and
gain a little emotional space from the judgments of others. There's a
refreshing tone to your life once you accept the truth about something
you've been stuffing under the rug. 2021, in general, is a time for you
to face the music, and see how special you really are! Stop being so hard
on yourself, loving Cancer!
