Energy and vitality can return this month, giving you an advantage as you 
roll into 2021. As feisty Mars moves into your sign, you’ll feel invigorated
and notice a renewed determination to exercise and get fit.

If you begin a new health regimen, don’t stop and start. Instead, find a way
to keep at it even if it means paying for a personal trainer. Their support
could be invaluable.

You could be busy with your goals and ambitions, but don’t use this as an 
excuse to neglect your well-being. If you want to succeed, staying healthy 
is vital to achieving your dreams.
