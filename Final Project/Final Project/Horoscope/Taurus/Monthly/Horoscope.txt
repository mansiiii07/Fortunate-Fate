Prepare for a surge of energy and momentum, Taurus, because mighty Mars 
ignites your solar first house of identity beginning on January 6 and for 
the coming two months. You will have more fuel to tackle all of your 
heartfelt goals and plans.

Also, with Jupiter and Saturn bringing extra strength to your career at 
this time, you could find that the approaching two months are major for 
rising higher than ever before. During the weeks ahead, you will be able 
to turn over a new leaf, be more hypnotic than usual, and assert yourself 
finally after nearly six months of being held back.

Lovely Venus enters your professional sector on the eighth, adding further 
luck to your path for the rest of the month.

A new moon in your solar ninth house appears on January 12, opening a door 
for you to step toward new horizons. Some Taurus will soon begin movement on 
an academic, media, or international project at this time. Get ready to soar!

Uranus, which has been in your zodiac sign since 2018, will awaken on the 
fourteenth, electrifying you for months to come to embrace more authenticity 
and power in all ways.

However, be sure to sign contracts as soon as you can because Mercury will 
start to slow down for another retrograde that begins at the end of the month.

Finally, to end January, a full moon takes place in your solar fourth house of 
home and family on January 28. This will bring a culmination regarding a living 
situation or require you to aid a family member in need. Jump on it now.
