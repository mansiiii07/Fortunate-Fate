Taurus! There's a ton of unpacking you have yet to do, and yet you do not 
even know where to fully begin. You've been experiencing the lessons of 
having the planet of chaos charging through your sign with both glimpses 
in 2018 and moving full-on in 2019. However, this year adds a bit of strife 
to this energy.

Uranus does not like constraints under any circumstances, and as Saturn 
opens the year strongly situated in fellow fixed sign Aquarius, you could 
find yourself in a continual crossroads. In fact, this is the overall energy 
of your year. Feeling like you are moving forward and being yanked into 
place having to wait for changes to take their full effect. You might see 
through things so much that at times, it might even anger you. This year 
requires a great deal of maturity and patience on your part. Yes, there can 
feel like great losses, mainly not through your own undoing, but through the 
continual clash between Saturn in the Water-bearing Aquarius and outer-body 
Uranus in your sign.

The year's lunar cycles are eye-opening in your personal zones of self-
acceptance and spiritual growth. The May 26 total lunar eclipse in 
Sagittarius does shed light on those areas of your life that you've tried 
to sweep under the rug. Understand that eclipses are galvanizing energy 
that truly wants you to get real with yourself so that you may heal from 
this situation. The annual solar eclipse in Gemini on June 10 can add some 
clarity to your overall financial destinyâ€”also reflected with a partial 
lunar eclipse in your sign of the Bull on November 19. Then luckily, you'll 
feel the weight off your shoulders on December 4 as the total solar eclipse 
sees you revisiting certain events and scenarios around your karmic connections, 
this time with a renewed sense of self.
