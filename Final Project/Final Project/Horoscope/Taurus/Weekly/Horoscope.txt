Watch what you say at the office this week, Taurus. It could affect your 
reputation. On Tuesday, Mercury in Aquarius squares Uranus in your sign, 
creating some tension between you and your colleagues as you try to break 
from tradition and strive for new ways of doing things. Try to advocate 
for your ideas without ruffling any feathers.

Midweek, keep your focus on the future when there’s a new moon in ambitious
 Capricorn and your philosophy sector. Where do you see yourself in five years?
 Graduating from college? Living in another country? Being your own boss? 
Start thinking about your goals on a different level.

Don’t let work stress ruin your Sunday when Jupiter in Aquarius squares Uranus 
in your sign, creating some drama and tension in your career. This is a reminder 
that your job doesn’t define who you are as a person, so don’t let it! Take some 
time for yourself.
