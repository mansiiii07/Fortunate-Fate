A new year begins with just a few days left with your ruler Mars powering
up your solar first house of identity. You have harbored this mighty
strength for the last six months, and it clearly moved you to take control
of your life.

However, beginning January 6, Mars enters your solar second house of
finances where it remains for the next two months. In the coming weeks,
you have the fighting power to streamline your accounting. This fuel will
likely increase your expenses quite a bit during this time, but it also
gives you a chance to make more through all of your gusto.

Lovely Venus enters your solar eleventh house of communities on the eighth,
adding more focus to the Aquarian stellium in the sky. This assures that
youâ€™ll hear from many friends in the several weeks to come and could even
enjoy quite a bit of social activity.

A new moon in your solar tenth house of achievement appears on January 13,
opening a doorway in your professional life. In the coming days, a new project,
promotion, or career opportunity is likely to arrive. Mercury begins to slow
down midmonth, readying for an impending retrograde. Do your best to tie up
all contractual matters now if you can.

Finally, to end January, a roaring full moon in your solar fifth house of
fertility will rock the night on the twenty-eighth. This luminary may signal
a culmination with regard to love, creativity, or children. Embrace the many
exciting vibrations, Aries! You will truly enjoy 2021.
