The week starts on a positive note when Mercury in Aquarius conjoins
Jupiter on Monday, bringing some good news in the areas of friendship
and social issues. Keep the notifications on because some pleasant and
surprising news might arrive via text, DM, or alert.

The new moon is in ambitious Capricorn on Tuesday, encouraging us to
practice patience when it comes to personal goals and ambitions. It
could be a little frustrating to feel we aren’t getting ahead as quickly
as we’d like, but slow and steady wins the race!

Last, Uranus goes direct in Taurus on Thursday. While we usually breathe
a sigh of relief when a planet moves forward, rebellious Uranus isn’t
like other planets. After holding in our emotions, especially anger,
Uranus moving direct allows us to let it all out. Just make sure to do
it in healthy, nondestructive ways.
