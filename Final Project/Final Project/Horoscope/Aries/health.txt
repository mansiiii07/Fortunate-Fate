The sensitive side of your nature desires what's best for those you
love - there is a deep feeling of "I would die for you" running through
you with regard to your loved ones and your children. This intense emotion
can be channeled into a more productive vein: caring for your body as
though it were a loved one. Taking care of all its needs can be quite
satisfying. This is ultimately nurturing for EVERYONE! Your life certainly
does depend on your body.
