You have a reason to celebrate as Mars enters Taurus and your house of
money on January 6. Now you have the ability to take direct action on
your money goals, pay down some debt, or work on your business.

There's a new moon in Capricorn on the twelfth at about the same time
that Mars, your planetary ruler, squares Saturn. Recognition in your
career is quite possible; however, getting the salary increase you
were promised could be more challenging. Management will have myriad
reasons to hold back the funds, which might look good on paper but
not satisfy your ambitions. That said, this isnâ€™t a great aspect for
moving on just yet. Cool your heels and wait for your moment.

On January 28, there's a full moon in Leo, and Mercury goes retrograde
in Aquarius two days later. It's decision time, and you may be considering
 taking a risk in your business. This could mean launching a new product,
building a shopping cart for your website, or selling your company.
But with Mercury retrograde, it's good to make plans and collect prospects
as you hold back the launch for a few weeks.
