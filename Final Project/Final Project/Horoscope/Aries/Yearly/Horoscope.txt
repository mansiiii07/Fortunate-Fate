Your week starts on a fun note when Mercury in Aquarius conjoins Jupiter.
There is a great deal to be learned through the other side of the story
these days, Aries. 2020 brought out your more practical and protective
side. You were forced to dive so deeply inward, and now you know what
you are able to take, and what you can no longer tolerate in your life.

As you pummel into 2021 with your naturally inquisitive nature, there
can be an honest review of where you want to direct the show. This means
that you must take authority back in some capacity throughout the year.

Saturn's influence in Aquarius sextiles your sign nicely, giving you a
boost of confidence in your career pursuits. This energy can even help
you heal some issues around respect and open your mind to new and
different methods of leadership. This holds true for you even when a
square formed between Saturn in the Water-bearing sign and Uranus in
your neighboring sign of Taurus on February 17, June 14, and December 24.
There's a direct emphasis on your self-worth during these months as you
become more aware of what is best for the greater good.

You might feel torn at times if you are striving hard and finding strength
by following your own direction. If you keep your eye on the prize, you
will not leave anyone behind. In fact, you are carving a lesser-known path
to lead the way for an entire community. This year, certain lunar eclipses
vacillate between Sagittarius and Gemini, activating your personal zones
of higher learning and spiritual development, and requiring you to find
the words for what you are feeling.

In 2021, you might have many moments of precognition or feel more in
alignment with your intuition, especially surrounding the Sagittarian
eclipses, being a May 26 total lunar eclipse and a total solar eclipse
on December 4.
