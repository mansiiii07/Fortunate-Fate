Your week starts on a fun note when Mercury in Aquarius conjoins Jupiter.
This aspect occurs in your sector of friendship, encouraging you to reach
out to others. A funny meme in your group chat or a fun video hangout is
just what you need to start the week.

And you’re gonna need that support on Tuesday when the new moon is in
Capricorn and Wednesday when Mars in Taurus squares Saturn in Aquarius,
creating stress at work. Don’t get upset if you hit some roadblocks.
You might just have to do some creative thinking.

Try not to lose your temper when Uranus goes direct in Taurus on Thursday.
You could feel the sudden urge to quit your job, sell your stuff, and
live off the grid. While the thought is very romantic, don’t make big
decisions in the heat of the moment or the dead of winter.
