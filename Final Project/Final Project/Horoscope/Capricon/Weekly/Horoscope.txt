Your week begins on a bit of a sour note when Mercury in Aquarius squares
Uranus in Taurus on Tuesday. You could be dying to have fun outside, but
your budget simply won’t allow the extra expense. Instead of moping at home,
try to find ways to have fun without spending a lot of money. Get creative!

Fortunately, your luck turns around when the new moon is in your sign
midweek, bringing you into your personal power. This is an excellent
opportunity to make changes that will improve your life in the long run.
Start working toward some new goals.

Continue your quest for self-improvement when the sun in your sign conjoins
Pluto on Thursday, making it an ideal time for personal transformation and
self-reflection. Take a moment to look at your journey so far: where you’ve
been and where you would like to be. You’re doing great, Capricorn.
