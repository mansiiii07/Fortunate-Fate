You have woken up to a different version of yourself this year, Capricorn!
You are a unique soul that is here for a welcoming purpose on this earth!
The presence of your home planet Saturn through the sign of Aquarius is in
full force this year, and has many lessons for your sign of the Goat to
take in and process.

There is some element of psychology pulling at you, which requires you to
be wise beyond your years. You are experiencing a new world for yourself,
and might even long for things to go back to the way they were. But the
innovative influence of Aquarius will have you feeling more emotionally
detached from your partnerships and friendships, pulling you into the future!

As a sign who often puts work over love, this can be a little easier for
those Goats who just want some energy to jump into their professional life
with zero constraints. For those who are ignoring your relationship duties
because work gets in the way, this is a year where you can truly come
face-to-face in this respect, and be open about your feelings.

There is some pattern that needs to be reassessed in your overall life.
The difficult square between Saturn in Aquarius and Uranus in Taurus takes
you away from the original structure you once perceived to be the rules,
and now asks you to be a little more radical and step out of your own way.
The turning points this year are not limited to mid-February, mid-June, and
late December, but do bring on these squares in strong. This is a lesson
that will test your self-esteem, but that is meant to cleanse your second
chakra of creativity.
