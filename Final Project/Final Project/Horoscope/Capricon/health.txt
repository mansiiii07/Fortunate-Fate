You may feel unusually cross or ill-tempered during this time. Emotions
loom large and seem practically unmanageable; your body seems to have a
mind of its own, cravings may feel too strong to push aside. This is
perfectly natural. One useful herbal remedy for this feeling is Chamomile
tea. Chamomile is known as the "baby remedy," for it soothes a cranky baby
and restores balance after a fever. You may drink the tea or actually put
teabags in your bath!
