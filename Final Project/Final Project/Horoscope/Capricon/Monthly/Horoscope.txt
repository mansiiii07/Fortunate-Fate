With the mighty sun igniting your zodiac sign at this time, it is your
birthday season! You have or will soon go through your solar return, when
you can make important plans for the year ahead. Consider how youâ€™d like
to build your life, and take action to manifest your goals in the days
that follow the new moon that takes place on January 12 in your zodiac
sign. This provides a doorway for you to pursue some of your most heartfelt
plans and desires. This luminary provides the boost you need to aim high
and to soar.

It is also clear that passion and love will be important to you right
now as Mars heats up your solar fifth house until March. Single Capricorns
will have a tremendous opportunity to find a soul-mate connection, whereas
committed ones may feel the spice reignite within their relationship. Those
Capricorns pursuing conception and pregnancy also have Mars on their side.

Another major focus this month is money, and the universe is especially
focused on bringing you more. You have the Midas touch now and for the year
ahead, so hustle and watch it come to you like a magnet.

However, if you need to sign new contracts, be aware that Mercury rules
communication and is approaching another retrograde, which begins on the
thirtieth. Try to tie up any legal issues before that.

Last to note is that you will experience a full moon in your solar eighth
house on January 28, which could spotlight a debt, loan, scholarship, or
investment matter. Be aware, though, that with the approaching retrograde,
you need to read the fine print before you lock yourself into something
long term.
