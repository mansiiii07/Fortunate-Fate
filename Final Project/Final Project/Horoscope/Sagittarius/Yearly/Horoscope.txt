What an absolute turning point kind of year 2021 will be for you, Sagittarius!
There is a miraculous energy all around you that is quite refreshing for
your benevolent sign of the Centaur. You will have times of massive
self-reflection that can trigger old wounds, also met by extremely gracious
moments of friendship!

The presence of the lunar and solar eclipses cycle through both, your
personal sign and opposing realm of the Twins. This helps you get a full
perspective and observe the world through a brand-new scope. You have
various mass realizations this year that will set you on a successful
course.

The May 26 total lunar eclipse in your sign, for example, provides a
massive release in your personal life that is both purifying and strengthening.
This can be an energetic blockage you've had for years that lifts and
releases from your life. You may feel more exposed than normal, but that
is the point of these shifts.

Later on, as an illuminating annular solar eclipse in Gemini galvanizes
your personal seventh house of partnerships on June 10, there is no place
to hide! You are out and proud of whatever you believe in!

The goal this year is to get you expressing from a more heartfelt space.
Appreciating life, and living it up is what it's all about these days.
Even with the hardships of the world, your Jupiterian sign can really feel
the love even through the tougher of times. The year concludes with a total
solar eclipse in your sign on December 4, igniting your passions and bringing
fruitful messages from the cosmic forces that be!
