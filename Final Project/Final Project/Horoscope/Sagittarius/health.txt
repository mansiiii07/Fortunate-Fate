Today's planetary movement exerts an energy that might make you feel like
your dreams are just out of reach. Don't let this feeling discourage you, 
as it is only temporary. Use the transit to get in touch with what you
really want, so that you are able to take appropriate steps toward achieving
that. The body is a lump of clay, remember? You are the artist who shapes it.
As an artist, give yourself plenty of love and encouragement.
