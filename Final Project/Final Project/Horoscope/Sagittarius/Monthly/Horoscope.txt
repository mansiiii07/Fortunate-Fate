Get ready for your productivity to launch into hyperdrive at the onset of
January, Sagittarius. This firepower will be triggered by mighty Mars
blazing a trail through your solar sixth house of employment and fitness
until the beginning of March. You are set to be quite busy with work
projects or clients. Hustle hard because this will impress higher-ups who
are paying attention to your progress!

Money will also be on your mind at this time with the sun igniting this
area of your life. A new moon dawns here on January 12 and opens a doorway
for you to get a new job, add more income to your freelance routine, or
even possibly get a raise. Rake in the abundance and work for more because
you will be supremely blessed.

Next to note this month is a great deal of focus on your mind and communication,
with so much planetary activity here now and for the year ahead. Yet be aware
that a Mercury retrograde will begin to creep in as early as midmonth, even
though it officially starts on the thirtieth. Do your best to be patient because
some revisions and reviews are likely to be asked of you.

Finally, to end the month, a powerful full moon in your solar ninth house on
January 28 encourages you to heed the urge to charge in new directions. While
this may allow some Sagittarians to jet off to exotic destinations, others
could be focused on legal, academic, media, or international business projects.
A great culmination is likely to take place.
