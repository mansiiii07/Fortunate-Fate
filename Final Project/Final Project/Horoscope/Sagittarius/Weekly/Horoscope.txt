Your week starts on a fun note when Mercury in Aquarius conjoins Jupiter.
On Monday, keep your phone near you at all times when Mercury in Aquarius
conjoins Jupiter in your sector of communication. Some unexpected good news
could come to you in the form of a text, DM, or alert. Whether it’s
something about siblings, travel plans, or a message you’ve been longing
for, it will be exciting.

However, you might not get good news about your spending when the new moon
is in Capricorn on Tuesday. The moon is in your sector of value, revealing
that there may not be as much cash in your travel fund as you’d hoped.
Think about ways you can make and save more money.

As the week comes to an end, don’t let a petty quarrel ruin your fun when
Jupiter in Aquarius squares Uranus in Taurus. Try to speak your feelings
in a clear, calm manner, Sagittarius, without letting your fiery nature
burn any bridges to communication.
