You usually like to make money just so you can have the pleasure of 
spending it, and now communication is more finely-tuned (aka, easier
to understand and deliver) about a new opportunity to make money. Look
to areas like fun activities, children, and even romance to find new ways
to bring in more each month. You might open a lemonade stand with your
child, or find that you have a real talent for matchmaking!
