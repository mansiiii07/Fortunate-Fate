January will be a bit slower for you for a few different reasons, Gemini. 
Mighty Mars, the giver of strength, drive, and energy, will be residing 
in your solar twelfth house of rest and healing for the first two months 
of the year. This means that you could still be focusing on tying up 
matters from 2020 or even working on an important project behind the scenes.

Despite this, your mind will be quite active with your ruler Mercury dancing
with Venus through your solar ninth house of expansion. You could be restless 
for new horizons or even contemplate an area such as academics, media, or 
immigration.

A new moon in your solar eighth house of shared assets appears on January 12,
filling you with the urge to merge. This will put a focus on partnerships, 
as well as if you’re having your needs met or you need to walk away. If you’ve
been in search of a loan, scholarship, or venture capital, it may begin to 
move forward now.

However, if you’re set to sign paperwork, which it looks like you will this 
month, do so soon because your ruler turns backward in the sky on the thirtieth. 
You will notice the slower pace as early as mid-January.

To end this month, a full moon appears in your solar third house of communication 
on January 28, and this could see you launching an important writing or speaking 
project now. Be careful what you say and announce, though, because Mercury’s 
impending retrograde could cause some confusion.
