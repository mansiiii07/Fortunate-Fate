Monday brings new points of view when Mercury in Aquarius conjoins Jupiter 
in your sector of philosophy. This could manifest itself in hearing some 
good news about future long-distance travel plans, education, or just 
developing a new philosophy of life. Share your new ideas with others!

However, get ready for some conflict on Tuesday when Mercury squares Uranus
 in Taurus. Could your unconscious beliefs be preventing you from learning 
something new? It might be uncomfortable confronting your biases, but it will 
help you grow as a person. Allow yourself to be wrong, Gemini.

Also on Tuesday, the new moon in Capricorn encourages growth even if it 
doesn’t come easily. The new moon is in your sector of intimacy, encouraging
personal transformation and even a rebirth. This change won’t happen 
overnight, but it will be worth it if you persist. Now is the ideal time to 
let go of the past.
